p225_001.txt|EN-US|EN|Please call Stella.
p225_002.txt|EN-US|EN|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p225_003.txt|EN-US|EN|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p225_004.txt|EN-US|EN|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p225_005.txt|EN-US|EN|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p225_006.txt|EN-US|EN|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p225_007.txt|EN-US|EN|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p225_008.txt|EN-US|EN|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p225_009.txt|EN-US|EN|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p225_010.txt|EN-US|EN|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p225_011.txt|EN-US|EN|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p225_012.txt|EN-US|EN|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p225_013.txt|EN-US|EN|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p225_014.txt|EN-US|EN|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p225_016.txt|EN-US|EN|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p225_017.txt|EN-US|EN|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p225_018.txt|EN-US|EN|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p225_019.txt|EN-US|EN|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p225_020.txt|EN-US|EN|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p225_021.txt|EN-US|EN|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p225_022.txt|EN-US|EN|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p225_023.txt|EN-US|EN|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p225_024.txt|EN-US|EN|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p225_025.txt|EN-US|EN|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p225_026.txt|EN-US|EN|How are you, sir ?
p225_027.txt|EN-US|EN|So is that it, then ?
p225_028.txt|EN-US|EN|Do I have a favourite ?
p225_029.txt|EN-US|EN|What do we do ?
p225_030.txt|EN-US|EN|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p225_033.txt|EN-US|EN|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
p225_035.txt|EN-US|EN|A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
p225_036.txt|EN-US|EN|It was a close call.

p225_038.txt|EN-US|EN|Diving is no part of football.
p225_039.txt|EN-US|EN|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p225_040.txt|EN-US|EN|You'd better believe it.
p225_044.txt|EN-US|EN|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p225_045.txt|EN-US|EN|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
p225_046.txt|EN-US|EN|No details of the talks were given.
p225_049.txt|EN-US|EN|I have learned from him.
p225_051.txt|EN-US|EN|We are committed to the ban.
p225_052.txt|EN-US|EN|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p225_053.txt|EN-US|EN|I have made that offer.
p225_054.txt|EN-US|EN|Four other charges were dropped.
p225_056.txt|EN-US|EN|Clearly, it can go either way.
p225_057.txt|EN-US|EN|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
p225_058.txt|EN-US|EN|However, the problem is the timing.
p225_059.txt|EN-US|EN|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
p225_060.txt|EN-US|EN|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p225_061.txt|EN-US|EN|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p225_062.txt|EN-US|EN|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p225_063.txt|EN-US|EN|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p225_064.txt|EN-US|EN|It could take some time.
p225_065.txt|EN-US|EN|There is no pressure on us.
p225_066.txt|EN-US|EN|It is a job creation scheme.
p225_067.txt|EN-US|EN|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p225_070.txt|EN-US|EN|That is bound to happen.
p225_071.txt|EN-US|EN|He is in the queue.
p225_072.txt|EN-US|EN|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p225_073.txt|EN-US|EN|So, did she meet him ?
p225_081.txt|EN-US|EN|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p225_082.txt|EN-US|EN|That view is held by many others within the industry.
p225_083.txt|EN-US|EN|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p225_084.txt|EN-US|EN|He is delighted, and he has every right to be.
p225_086.txt|EN-US|EN|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p225_089.txt|EN-US|EN|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p225_090.txt|EN-US|EN|I did not have a bet on myself.
p225_092.txt|EN-US|EN|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p225_094.txt|EN-US|EN|That's as it should be.
p225_103.txt|EN-US|EN|Everyone deserves to share in this success.
p225_104.txt|EN-US|EN|His is a success story by any standard.
p225_108.txt|EN-US|EN|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p225_109.txt|EN-US|EN|That might help a bit.
p225_110.txt|EN-US|EN|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p225_111.txt|EN-US|EN|It isn't a happy memory.
p225_113.txt|EN-US|EN|The big issue for us is the review.
p225_114.txt|EN-US|EN|I told him I was a long time ago.
p225_115.txt|EN-US|EN|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p225_116.txt|EN-US|EN|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p225_117.txt|EN-US|EN|We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.
p225_118.txt|EN-US|EN|We suffered a lot for seven years.
p225_120.txt|EN-US|EN|The industry is not well organised.
p225_121.txt|EN-US|EN|You get a lot for your money.
p225_122.txt|EN-US|EN|I didn't feel under any pressure.
p225_123.txt|EN-US|EN|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p225_124.txt|EN-US|EN|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p225_126.txt|EN-US|EN|The squad is too small.
p225_127.txt|EN-US|EN|It is a common problem.
p225_128.txt|EN-US|EN|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p225_131.txt|EN-US|EN|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
p225_133.txt|EN-US|EN|I think he's the favourite.
p225_135.txt|EN-US|EN|We have seen a copy of the report.
p225_136.txt|EN-US|EN|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
p225_141.txt|EN-US|EN|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
p225_142.txt|EN-US|EN|Well, you can have a tree.
p225_143.txt|EN-US|EN|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
p225_144.txt|EN-US|EN|She will do for me.
p225_145.txt|EN-US|EN|Why change it ?
p225_147.txt|EN-US|EN|Does the name matter ?
p225_149.txt|EN-US|EN|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
p225_150.txt|EN-US|EN|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p225_151.txt|EN-US|EN|Nothing has been put into action.
p225_152.txt|EN-US|EN|The weather forecast isn't good.
p225_153.txt|EN-US|EN|We have a clean bill of health.
p225_156.txt|EN-US|EN|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p225_157.txt|EN-US|EN|He was asked to quit.
p225_158.txt|EN-US|EN|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p225_159.txt|EN-US|EN|Neither side can win this war.
p225_165.txt|EN-US|EN|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p225_166.txt|EN-US|EN|Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.
p225_169.txt|EN-US|EN|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
p225_171.txt|EN-US|EN|The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.
p225_172.txt|EN-US|EN|Nobody did in those days.
p225_173.txt|EN-US|EN|But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.
p225_174.txt|EN-US|EN|He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
p225_175.txt|EN-US|EN|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
p225_176.txt|EN-US|EN|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p225_177.txt|EN-US|EN|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p225_179.txt|EN-US|EN|They know no other way.
p225_182.txt|EN-US|EN|We are just glad to be alive.
p225_191.txt|EN-US|EN|People will ask about us.
p225_192.txt|EN-US|EN|However, this idea is never developed.
p225_193.txt|EN-US|EN|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p225_195.txt|EN-US|EN|It is hard to tell.
p225_196.txt|EN-US|EN|I think, therefore I am ?

p225_199.txt|EN-US|EN|And they were being paid ?
p225_200.txt|EN-US|EN|It looked like a river.
p225_201.txt|EN-US|EN|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.

p225_208.txt|EN-US|EN|You are a great player.
p225_210.txt|EN-US|EN|Scotland will play its part.
p225_211.txt|EN-US|EN|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
p225_212.txt|EN-US|EN|After that nothing could save him.
p225_218.txt|EN-US|EN|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p225_219.txt|EN-US|EN|They did not attack the themes of the book.
p225_220.txt|EN-US|EN|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p225_221.txt|EN-US|EN|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p225_222.txt|EN-US|EN|In each case they were a goal down.
p225_223.txt|EN-US|EN|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p225_224.txt|EN-US|EN|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p225_225.txt|EN-US|EN|It is good for our team.
p225_235.txt|EN-US|EN|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
p225_236.txt|EN-US|EN|That will be the criteria for the future.
p225_237.txt|EN-US|EN|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
p225_238.txt|EN-US|EN|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p225_239.txt|EN-US|EN|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
p225_240.txt|EN-US|EN|We are in the hat.
p225_241.txt|EN-US|EN|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p225_242.txt|EN-US|EN|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p225_243.txt|EN-US|EN|The irony was not lost.
p225_244.txt|EN-US|EN|What was the matter for concern ?
p225_248.txt|EN-US|EN|Does that put pressure on us ?
p225_253.txt|EN-US|EN|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p225_254.txt|EN-US|EN|The problem was a social problem.
p225_257.txt|EN-US|EN|My son was too young to die.
p225_258.txt|EN-US|EN|We were not allowed to go to help them.
p225_264.txt|EN-US|EN|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.

p225_275.txt|EN-US|EN|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p225_276.txt|EN-US|EN|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p225_277.txt|EN-US|EN|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p225_279.txt|EN-US|EN|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p225_280.txt|EN-US|EN|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
